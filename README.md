# CricLive 
CricLive app helps users to follow live cricket matches and trending cricket news.

When application is started, app fetches the list of recent matches (live, upcoming and completed) and presents them to the user.
User can tap on a live / completed match to view detailed information of the match. This page refreshes itself every 10 seconds and users can also do a pull to refresh for refreshing scores.

The news section currently focusses only on youtube videos. When a user selects the news tab, latest youtube articles are fetched and tapping on a article will open the video in safari / youtube app (if youtube app is installed on the phone).
Users can again pull to refresh to refresh news.
